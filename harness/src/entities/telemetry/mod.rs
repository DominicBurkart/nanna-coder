//! Sandbox Telemetry Entities (TODO)
//!
//! This module will implement telemetry entities for runtime observability
//! and metrics from sandbox execution.
//!
//! See issue #27 and ARCHITECTURE.md for details.
//!
//! NOTE: This implementation is deferred due to per-project configuration
//! requirements and larger scope.

// Placeholder for telemetry entity implementation
// Full implementation tracked in issue #27 (marked as TODO)
