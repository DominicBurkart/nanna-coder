GitHub Actions provides a caching mechanism through the official `actions/cache` action that can be used to cache dependencies and build outputs to speed up workflows. This caching can be used on GitHub-hosted runners as well as self-hosted runners.

For small open-source projects using GitHub-hosted runners:
- Caching is supported directly by GitHub Actions using `actions/cache` where cache keys can be based on OS, file hashes, or other parameters.
- The cache is stored by GitHub, and there is a 10 GB cache size limit per repository.
- This works well to avoid repeated downloads of dependencies and build artifacts during CI runs.

For self-hosted runners or ephemeral runners:
- The cache is still uploaded/downloaded from GitHub's storage, which can be slower and introduce latency.
- There are community requests and some experimental approaches to use local or cluster storage (e.g., persistent volumes or S3 storage) as cache backends, but this is not natively supported by GitHub Actions.
- Some third-party tools or workarounds exist to help with local cache storage for self-hosted runners, but they require setup and aren't official GitHub features.

Therefore, if the question is about having caching like Cachix (a dedicated caching service for Nix builds) but using only GitHub CI runners for a small open-source project, this is feasible using `actions/cache` on GitHub-hosted runners, with caching done via GitHub's storage. 

However, if the desire is to have local caching on the runners themselves (to avoid GitHub cache storage overhead or to share cache across self-hosted runners without going to GitHub's cloud), that is not directly supported by GitHub Actions by default. Such local caching setups require additional infrastructure or third-party solutions.

In summary:
- Yes, similar caching is possible with GitHub CI runners using the official cache action for dependencies/builds.
- This caching is cloud cache maintained by GitHub, not local runner-level cache.
- Local caching on self-hosted runners similar to Cachix would require custom setup or external tools.

This matches common use for small open-source projects relying on GitHub's infrastructure for cache storage and speedup of CI runs.[4][5][9]
